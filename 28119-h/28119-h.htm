<p class="pr1"><big><b>He wondered if I'd told her everything, and, faltering, I
had to admit that I hadn't. She was wonderful&mdash;but human.</b></big></p></div>

<p><span class="dcap">My mother</span> was a lovely,
delicate woman from the
coast of Brittany, who was
miserable sleeping on less
than three mattresses, and
who, it is said, was once injured
by a falling leaf in her
garden. My grandfather, a
descendant of the French nobility
whose family had ridden
the tumbrils of the Revolution,
tended her fragile
body and spirit with the
same loving care given rare,
brief-blooming flowers. You
may imagine from this his
attitude concerning marriage.
He lived in terror of
the vulgar, heavy-handed
man who would one day win
my mother's heart, and at
last, this persistent dread
killed him. His concern was
unnecessary, however, for my
mother chose a suitor who
was as free of mundane brutality
as a husband could be.
Her choice was Dauphin, a
remarkable white cat which
strayed onto the estate shortly
after his death.</p>

<p>Dauphin was an unusually
large Angora, and his ability
to speak in cultured French,
English, and Italian was sufficient
to cause my mother
to adopt him as a household
pet. It did not take long for
her to realize that Dauphin
deserved a higher status, and
he became her friend, protector,
and confidante. He
never spoke of his origin, nor
where he had acquired the
classical education which
made him such an entertaining
companion. After two
years, it was easy for my
mother, an unworldly woman
at best, to forget the dissimilarity
in their species. In
fact, she was convinced that
Dauphin was an enchanted
prince, and Dauphin, in consideration
of her illusions,
never dissuaded her. At last,
they were married by an understanding
clergyman of
the locale, who solemnly
filled in the marriage application
with the name of M.
Edwarde Dauphin.</p>

<p>I, Etienne Dauphin, am
their son.</p>

<p>To be candid, I am a handsome
youth, not unlike my
mother in the delicacy of my
features. My father's heritage
is evident in my large, feline
eyes, and in my slight body
and quick movements. My
mother's death, when I was
four, left me in the charge of
my father and his coterie of
loyal servants, and I could not
have wished for a finer upbringing.
It is to my father's
patient tutoring that I owe
whatever graces I now
possess. It was my father, the
cat, whose gentle paws guided
me to the treasure houses of
literature, art, and music,
whose whiskers bristled with
pleasure at a goose well
cooked, at a meal well served,
at a wine well chosen. How
many happy hours we shared!
He knew more of life and the
humanities, my father, the cat,
than any human I have met in
all my twenty-three years.</p>

<p>Until the age of eighteen,
my education was his personal
challenge. Then, it was his desire
to send me into the world
outside the gates. He chose for
me a university in America,
for he was deeply fond of
what he called "that great raw
country," where he believed
my feline qualities might be
tempered by the aggressiveness
of the rough-coated barking
dogs I would be sure to
meet.</p>

<p>I must confess to a certain
amount of unhappiness in my
early American years, torn as
I was from the comforts of the
estate and the wisdom of my
father, the cat. But I became
adapted, and even upon my
graduation from the university,
sought and held employment
in a metropolitan art museum.
It was there I met Joanna,
the young woman I intended
to make my bride.</p>

<p>Joanna was a product of the
great American southwest, the
daughter of a cattle-raiser.
There was a blooming vitality
in her face and her body, a
lustiness born of open skies
and desert. Her hair was not
the gold of antiquity; it was
new gold, freshly mined from
the black rock. Her eyes were
not like old-world diamonds;
their sparkle was that of sunlight
on a cascading river. Her
figure was bold, an open declaration
of her sex.</p>

<p>She was, perhaps, an unusual
choice for the son of fairy-like
mother and an Angora
cat. But from the first meeting
of our eyes, I knew that I
would someday bring Joanna
to my father's estate to present
her as my fiancee.</p>

<p>I approached that occasion
with understandable trepidation.
My father had been explicit
in his advice before I
departed for America, but on
no point had he been more
emphatic than secrecy concerning
himself. He assured
me that revelation of my paternity
would bring ridicule
and unhappiness upon me. The
advice was sound, of course,
and not even Joanna knew
that our journey's end would
bring us to the estate of a
large, cultured, and conversing
cat. I had deliberately fostered
the impression that I
was orphaned, believing that
the proper place for revealing
the truth was the atmosphere
of my father's home in France.
I was certain that Joanna
would accept her father-in-law
without distress. Indeed,
hadn't nearly a score of human
servants remained devoted to
their feline master for almost
a generation?</p>

<p>We had agreed to be wed
on the first of June, and on
May the fourth, emplaned in
New York for Paris. We were
met at Orly Field by Francois,
my father's solemn manservant,
who had been delegated
not so much as escort as
he was chaperone, my father
having retained much of the
old world proprieties. It was a
long trip by automobile to
our estate in Brittany, and I
must admit to a brooding silence
throughout the drive
which frankly puzzled Joanna.</p>

<p>However, when the great
stone fortress that was our
home came within view, my
fears and doubts were quickly
dispelled. Joanna, like so
many Americans, was thrilled
at the aura of venerability and
royal custom surrounding the
estate. Francois placed her in
charge of Madame Jolinet,
who clapped her plump old
hands with delight at the
sight of her fresh blonde
beauty, and chattered and
clucked like a mother hen as
she led Joanna to her room on
the second floor. As for myself,
I had one immediate
wish: to see my father, the
cat.</p>

<p>He greeted me in the library,
where he had been anxiously
awaiting our arrival,
curled up in his favorite chair
by the fireside, a wide-mouthed
goblet of cognac by
his side. As I entered the
room, he lifted a paw formally,
but then his reserve was
dissolved by the emotion of
our reunion, and he licked my
face in unashamed joy.</p>

<p>Francois refreshed his
glass, and poured another for
me, and we toasted each
other's well-being.</p>

<p>"To you, <i>mon purr</i>," I said,
using the affectionate name
of my childhood memory.</p>

<p>"To Joanna," my father
said. He smacked his lips over
the cognac, and wiped his
whiskers gravely. "And where
is this paragon?"</p>

<p>"With Madame Jolinet.
She will be down shortly."</p>

<p>"And you have told her
everything?"</p>

<p>I blushed. "No, <i>mon purr</i>,
I have not. I thought it best
to wait until we were home.
She is a wonderful woman,"
I added impulsively. "She
will not be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Horrified?" my father
said. "What makes you so
certain, my son?"</p>

<p>"Because she is a woman of
great heart," I said stoutly.
"She was educated at a fine
college for women in Eastern
America. Her ancestors
were rugged people, given to
legend and folklore. She is a
warm, human person&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Human," my father sighed,
and his tail swished. "You
are expecting too much of
your beloved, Etienne. Even
a woman of the finest character
may be dismayed in this
situation."</p>

<p>"But my mother&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your mother was an exception,
a changeling of the
Fairies. You must not look
for your mother's soul in
Joanna's eyes." He jumped
from his chair, and came towards
me, resting his paw
upon my knee. "I am glad
you have not spoken of me,
Etienne. Now you must keep
your silence forever."</p>

<p>I was shocked. I reached
down and touched my father's
silky fur, saddened by
the look of his age in his
gray, gold-flecked eyes, and
by the tinge of yellow in his
white coat.</p>

<p>"No, <i>mon purr</i>," I said.
"Joanna must know the truth.
Joanna must know how proud
I am to be the son of Edwarde
Dauphin."</p>

<p>"Then you will lose her."</p>

<p>"Never! That cannot happen!"</p>

<p>My father walked stiffly
to the fireplace, staring into
the gray ashes. "Ring for
Francois," he said. "Let him
build the fire. I am cold,
Etienne."</p>

<p>I walked to the cord and
pulled it. My father turned
to me and said: "You must
wait, my son. At dinner this
evening, perhaps. Do not
speak of me until then."</p>

<p>"Very well, father."</p>

<p>When I left the library, I
encountered Joanna at the
head of the stairway, and
she spoke to me excitedly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Etienne! What a
<i>beautiful</i> old house. I know I
will love it! May we see the
rest?"</p>

<p>"Of course," I said.</p>

<p>"You look troubled. Is
something wrong?"</p>

<p>"No, no. I was thinking
how lovely you are."</p>

<p>We embraced, and her
warm full body against mine
confirmed my conviction
that we should never be
parted. She put her arm in
mine, and we strolled through
the great rooms of the house.
She was ecstatic at their size
and elegance, exclaiming over
the carpeting, the gnarled
furniture, the ancient silver
and pewter, the gallery of
family paintings. When she
came upon an early portrait of
my mother, her eyes misted.</p>

<p>"She was lovely," Joanna
said. "Like a princess! And
what of your father? Is there
no portrait of him?"</p>

<p>"No," I said hurriedly. "No
portrait." I had spoken my
first lie to Joanna, for there
was a painting, half-completed,
which my mother had
begun in the last year of her
life. It was a whispering little
watercolor, and Joanna discovered
it to my consternation.</p>

<p>"What a magnificent cat!"
she said. "Was it a pet?"</p>

<p>"It is Dauphin," I said nervously.</p>

<p>She laughed. "He has your
eyes, Etienne."</p>

<p>"Joanna, I must tell you
something&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And this ferocious gentleman
with the moustaches?
Who is he?"</p>

<p>"My grandfather. Joanna,
you must listen&mdash;"</p>

<p>Francois, who had been
following our inspection tour
at shadow's-length, interrupted.
I suspected that his timing
was no mere coincidence.</p>

<p>"We will be serving dinner
at seven-thirty," he said. "If
the lady would care to
dress&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course," Joanna said.
"Will you excuse me, Etienne?"</p>

<p>I bowed to her, and she
was gone.</p>

<p>At fifteen minutes to the
appointed dining time, I was
ready, and hastened below
to talk once more with my
father. He was in the dining
room, instructing the servants
as to the placement of the
silver and accessories. My
father was proud of the excellence
of his table, and
took all his meals in the
splendid manner. His appreciation
of food and wine was
unsurpassed in my experience,
and it had always been the
greatest of pleasures for me
to watch him at table, stalking
across the damask and
dipping delicately into the
silver dishes prepared for
him. He pretended to be too
busy with his dinner preparations
to engage me in conversation,
but I insisted.</p>

<p>"I must talk to you," I
said. "We must decide together
how to do this."</p>

<p>"It will not be easy," he
answered with a twinkle.
"Consider Joanna's view. A
cat as large and as old as myself
is cause enough for comment.
A cat that speaks is
alarming. A cat that dines at
table with the household is
shocking. And a cat whom
you must introduce as
your&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop it!" I cried. "Joanna
must know the truth. You
must help me reveal it to
her."</p>

<p>"Then you will not heed my
advice?"</p>

<p>"In all things but this. Our
marriage can never be happy
unless she accepts you for
what you are."</p>

<p>"And if there is no marriage?"</p>

<p>I would not admit to this
possibility. Joanna was mine;
nothing could alter that. The
look of pain and bewilderment
in my eyes must have been
evident to my father, for he
touched my arm gently with
his paw and said:</p>

<p>"I will help you, Etienne.
You must give me your
trust."</p>

<p>"Always!"</p>

<p>"Then come to dinner with
Joanna and explain nothing.
Wait for me to appear."</p>

<p>I grasped his paw and
raised it to my lips. "Thank
you, father!"</p>

<p>He turned to Francois, and
snapped: "You have my instructions?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," the servant replied.</p>

<p>"Then all is ready. I shall
return to my room now, Etienne.
You may bring your
fiancee to dine."</p>

<p>I hastened up the stairway,
and found Joanna ready,
strikingly beautiful in shimmering
white satin. Together,
we descended the grand
staircase and entered the
room.</p>

<p>Her eyes shone at the magnificence
of the service set
upon the table, at the soldiery
array of fine wines,
some of them already poured
into their proper glasses for
my father's enjoyment: <i>Haut
Medoc</i>, from <i>St. Estephe</i>,
authentic <i>Chablis</i>, <i>Epernay
Champagne</i>, and an American
import from the Napa Valley
of which he was fond. I waited
expectantly for his appearance
as we sipped our
aperitif, while Joanna chatted
about innocuous matters, with
no idea of the tormented state
I was in.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock, my father
had not yet made his appearance,
and I grew ever more
distraught as Francois signalled
for the serving of the
<i>bouillon au madere</i>. Had he
changed his mind? Would I
be left to explain my status
without his help? I hadn't
realized until this moment
how difficult a task I had allotted
for myself, and the fear
of losing Joanna was terrible
within me. The soup was flat
and tasteless on my tongue,
and the misery in my manner
was too apparent for Joanna
to miss.</p>

<p>"What is it, Etienne?" she
said. "You've been so morose
all day. Can't you tell me
what's wrong?"</p>

<p>"No, it's nothing. It's
just&mdash;" I let the impulse take
possession of my speech. "Joanna,
there's something I
should tell you. About my
mother, and my father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ahem," Francois said.</p>

<p>He turned to the doorway,
and our glances followed his.</p>

<p>"Oh, Etienne!" Joanna
cried, in a voice ringing with
delight.</p>

<p>It was my father, the cat,
watching us with his gray,
gold-flecked eyes. He approached
the dining table,
regarding Joanna with timidity
and caution.</p>

<p>"It's the cat in the painting!"
Joanna said. "You
didn't tell me he was here,
Etienne. He's beautiful!"</p>

<p>"Joanna, this is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dauphin! I would have
known him anywhere. Here,
Dauphin! Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty!"</p>

<p>Slowly, my father approached
her outstretched
hand, and allowed her to
scratch the thick fur on the
back of his neck.</p>

<p>"Aren't you the pretty little
pussy! Aren't you the sweetest
little thing!"</p>

<p>"Joanna!"</p>

<p>She lifted my father by the
haunches, and held him in her
lap, stroking his fur and cooing
the silly little words that
women address to their pets.
The sight pained and confused
me, and I sought to
find an opening word that
would allow me to explain,
yet hoping all the time that
my father would himself provide
the answer.</p>

<p>Then my father spoke.</p>

<p>"Meow," he said.</p>

<p>"Are you hungry?" Joanna
asked solicitously. "Is the
little pussy hungry?"</p>

<p>"Meow," my father said,
and I believed my heart broke
then and there. He leaped
from her lap and padded
across the room. I watched
him through blurred eyes as
he followed Francois to the
corner, where the servant had
placed a shallow bowl of
milk. He lapped at it eagerly,
until the last white drop
was gone. Then he yawned
and stretched, and trotted
back to the doorway, with
one fleeting glance in my
direction that spoke articulately
of what I must do next.</p>

<p>"What a wonderful animal,"
Joanna said.</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered. "He was
my mother's favorite."</p>
